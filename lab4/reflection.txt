Write a short reflection based on your lab experience (e.g. a text file inside your project). 
The format is free, but you can use these questions as a starting point:

-What did you learn? What did you know already?
Usage of classes and memory management.

-What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?
Might have misunderstood polyline. As is it creates an array with the specified size in the constructor.
Dropping an element of an array would involve resizing via coping array elements and that 
method felt out of scope for this lab.

-How can the lab be improved?


-Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.
